# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

Predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant.

The dataset was gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
The features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. 
They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
